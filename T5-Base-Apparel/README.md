# Base Apparel coming soon page

![Design preview for the Base Apparel coming soon page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

To build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Goals:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
